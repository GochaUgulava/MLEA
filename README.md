In the field of data analysis, particularly in the realm of economic data analysis involving large
and complex datasets, there is often a necessity to reduce the dimensionality of features. This becomes
especially pertinent when consolidating features that represent various factors into a single indicator,
which is subsequently used for comparative, correlational, causal, or other types of studies. Currently,
the potential benefits offered by a variety of powerful and efficient dimensionality reduction algorithms
and methods in machine learning are underutilized in economic analysis. This article offers a
comprehensive classification of the primary algorithms, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, and
explores the potential applications of these methods in economic analysis. The paper underscores the
importance of selecting the appropriate method, algorithm based on the specific research task, data
processing goals, data structure, and characteristics. It also delves into the criteria for assessing the
effectiveness of algorithm applications. Finally, by way of example, the article compares and analyzes the
results of applying different algorithms to a test set of economic data, confirming the efficacy of utilizing
these machine learning methods in economic analysis and the necessity for their wider implementation.
